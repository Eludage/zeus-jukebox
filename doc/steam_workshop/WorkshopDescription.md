[h2]Compatibility / Restrictions[/h2]

[list]
[*]When using [b]ACE[/b], fading out music is disabled as the ACE battle deafness system would override it.
[*]If music is played from another source than the Zeus Jukebox, it does not get detected as currently playing.
[*][b]Music without duration:[/b] If a music track has no duration declared in its config, it will show [b]0:00[/b] in the music list and will be defaulted to 3 minutes (180 seconds) when played. This can lead to music continuing to play silently after the actual track ends, or tracks being cut off early if they are longer than 3 minutes.
[/list]

Other than that, there are currently no known issues.
